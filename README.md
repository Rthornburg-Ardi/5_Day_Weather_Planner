# 5 Day Weather APP

## Description

This project was created to have a simple weather app that would allow you to look at the forcast of multiple cities over a 5 day time span. My motivation behind this project was to test my ability to used a server side API, combined with day.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I also was going to embark on a trip through New Mexico and was tired of how poor some weather apps allowed me to track the weather on the journey. I would have to drive over quiet a few mounain passes, that in bad weather will either close, or be extremely dangerous, this app allowed me to quickly map my routes and see what the weather was going to be like and determine if certain passes would be better than others. I used the weather API, which was provided by the instructions to get the forcasts for every location as well as across 5 days, ironcically how long I'd be traveling. I have gained a better familiarity with Day.js through the Workday Planner, I was currious to see how it tied into other APIs. I also was eager to apply what I learned in Bootcamp about APIs and their uses through using the Weather API. I learned how finiacky API keys and setting them up can be, as that was the hardest part of this exercise for me. I also learned that each API requires it's own syntax, which isn't always documented well.
