# 5 Day Weather APP

## Description

This project was created to have a simple weather app that allows you to look at the forecast of multiple cities over five days. My motivation behind this project was to test my ability to use a server-side API combined with day.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I was also going to embark on a trip through New Mexico and was tired of how poor some weather apps allowed me to track the weather on the journey. I would have to drive over quite a few mountain passes that, in bad weather, would either close or be extremely dangerous; this app allowed me to map my routes quickly, see what the weather was going to be like, and determine if certain passes would be better than others. I used the weather API provided by the instructions to get the forecasts for every location and, ironically, how long I'd be traveling across five days. I have gained a better familiarity with Day.js through the Workday Planner, I was currious to see how it tied into other APIs. I was also eager to apply what I learned in Bootcamp about APIs and their uses using the Weather API. I learned how finicky API keys and setting them up can be, which was the most challenging part of this exercise. I also learned that each API requires its syntax, which is sometimes documented poorly.
